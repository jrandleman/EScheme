This simplicity\nis a double edged sword though: while making <load> easy to implement, it leaves\nmuch to be desired with respect to enabling encapsulation of code across\ncoordinated Scheme files.\n\nAs such, in addition to <load>, EScheme offers a minimalistic module system\nthat strives to enable file-specific encapsulation of EScheme code. Files\nprocessed via the <import> macro are defined as <module> objects within the\nenclosing enivironment. See the <import> 'help' entry for more details on how\nEScheme evaluates modules.\n\nEach module has its own isolated global environment, and has automatic access\nto EScheme's standard library. Note that this means that operations that depend\non global variables (e.g. <load-once>) are hence only able to operate on\na module-relative basis.\n\n  * Note that <dosync> notably works across modules, since its internal lock\n    was created via <define-parameter>. Use <dosync-module> for module-relative\n    locking behavior.\n\nBoth variables and macros can be accessed from a module by using EScheme's\ndot-notation: for example, to access variable 'PersonClass' from module 'Mod',\nwe write 'Mod.PersonClass'.\n\nFurther note that imported modules are cached! Importing the same module\nmultiple times does not cause multiple evaluations of that module. Use the\n<reload> macro if you'd like to forcefully re-evaluate the module in question.\n\nAdditionally, the <from> macro may be used to load specific variables within\na given module, without defining that module itself as a local variable.\n\nModules may be introspected upon by 2 primitives:\n\n  1. <module-path>: yield the absolute file path to the module (this is what\n     distinguishes one module from another under the hood).\n  2. <module-bindings>: yield a list of the symbols defined in a module (beware:\n     every module redefines the entire EScheme standard library!).\n\nNote that the 'meta-thread's environment (see <thread-define>) is module\nindependant!\n\nUse the '*import*' variable to determine if the current file was <import>ed.\nCan combine with <unless> to mimic Python's \"if __name__=='__main__':\" pattern:\n\n  (unless *import*\n    <execute-main-escheme-code-here> ...)\n\nLastly, note that the concept of 'parameter' variables exist in order to\nhave global state shared across modules.
